This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and structure unstructured health care records, focusing on improving data quality in electronic health records (EHRs). Key tasks include noise removal, standardization of medical terminology, and handling incomplete or inconsistent data. By leveraging medical ontologies and deep learning models, the study demonstrates how NLP can enhance data accuracy and consistency, leading to improved analytics, clinical decision-making, and patient outcomes.
